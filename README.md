# Screen Recorder

**Reason for development:**
Sometimes there are situations where I need to record the screen, for example when I encounter a cheater in a game, another reason is that this program takes up little space and does not require installation, so it does not tire me out, and by integrating it into my voice assistant, I can automatically start screen recording whenever I want.


**Install Requairements:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
